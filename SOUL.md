## What is this project?

This project creates **digital twin archetypes** of Estonian high school students — synthetic LLM-based representations that capture how distinct groups of students interact with an AI learning tool.

## Why does it exist?

In 2026, OpenAI and AI Leap Foundation deployed a ChatGPT-based tool for high school students in Estonia. This generated a unique dataset: conversation texts and numerical graders, all tied to real student interactions. The opportunity is to distill this data into a small number of archetypes (roughly 3–15) that faithfully represent the diversity of student behavior — without requiring any personally identifiable information.

## What is it trying to prove?

The central hypothesis is that **student interaction patterns in an AI tool correlate with reading ability** — the strongest available PII-free proxy for general academic success. If digital twins can reproduce the same interaction-to-reading-ability relationship as real students, then the twins are valid stand-ins for studying and predicting student outcomes.

## What does success look like?

A set of digital twin LLMs that, when placed in the same conversational setting as real students, produce interaction patterns that cluster in the same way real students do — particularly with respect to estimated reading ability. If the clustering of twins mirrors the clustering of students, the twins are faithful representations.

## What does this enable?

Validated digital twins open the door to scalable, privacy-preserving educational research. Instead of requiring access to real student data for every experiment, researchers and tool designers can iterate against archetypes that behave like real students — testing interventions, refining pedagogy, and studying learning dynamics without touching PII.
